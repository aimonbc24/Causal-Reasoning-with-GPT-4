These models use directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to depict the causal structure of a system, where nodes represent variables and directed edges represent causal relationships between them. Causal models allow researchers to reason about the effects of interventions and to make counterfactual predictions.\n",

It provides a formal framework for answering questions about the causal effects of actions or interventions, which are represented by the \"do\" operator (do(X=x)). The do-calculus consists of three rules that allow researchers to manipulate and simplify expressions involving the do operator, ultimately enabling them to estimate causal effects from observational data under certain conditions.\n",
